# Match Simulation and Strategy Optimization

Develop a simulation model that replicates IPL matches based on historical data and player characteristics. Use reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize team strategies, such as batting order, fielding placements, and bowling tactics, to maximize the chances of winning. This can be a valuable tool for coaches and analysts to experiment with different strategies without real-time consequences.
