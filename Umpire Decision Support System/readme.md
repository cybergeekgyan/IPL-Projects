# Umpire Decision Support System

Develop an AI-based decision support system that assists on-field umpires in making accurate decisions, especially in complex situations such as run-outs and stumpings. Use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze video footage in real-time and provide additional insights and recommendations to umpires, reducing human errors.
